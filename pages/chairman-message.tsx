				<p>
          I would like to warmly welcome all the current and prospective recruiters to the Student Placement Office (SPO) of IIT Kanpur. In
          this age, demanding continual technology enhancements, the industry requires talented youngsters with outstanding analytical skills,
          open mindset and innovative approach towards problem solving. I am glad to convey that IIT Kanpur is home to such bright young
          minds. Our next batch of students is all set to graduate soon and they are looking for opportunities that are appealing to their
          intellect and would help them realize their full potential.
				</p>
				<p>
          At IIT Kanpur, we make every effort to hone the technical and analytical skills of our students through the rigorous coursework that
          focusses on up-to-date scientific knowledge and state-of-the-art technological know-hows in their respective disciplines. The UG
          curriculum of each department consists of certain compulsory courses on the institute level, core courses on the departmental level,
          departmental electives and open electives. The inclusion of open electives, wherein the students can opt for elective courses from
          any department, adds interdisciplinary component to the curriculum. In addition, each student is also required to take certain
          minimum course-credits in the department of Humanities and Social Sciences which greatly enhances their outlook towards the society
          and its needs. Our PG students, who are admitted at IITK after a very tough entrance procedure, undergo rigorous coursework
          consisting of advanced level courses. As the most essential part of their degree, they write their theses under the able supervision
          of our faculty who themselves are renowned researchers in their respective fields.
				</p>
				<p>
          During their stay at IIT Kanpur, our students also participate in myriad of extra-curricular activities, which exposes them to and
          tests their skills in sports, cultural, dramatics, music and, allows students to develop a healthy personality. The students also
          get first-hand experience in organization and management of events through various leadership positions they take up during several
          annual events organized at IIT Kanpur. It is therefore no wonder that a student graduating from IIT Kanpur has an all-round
          personality.
				</p>
				<p>
          SPO office facilitates the recruitment process for the students as well as the employers, by serving as an interface between the
          two. On the SPO portal, students can upload their resumes, which are then verified by a dedicated team of personnel at SPO. The
          employers can announce their job openings and job profiles after registering on the portal. The SPO strives to help both the
          students and employers in matching their interests and interacting with each other, with the ultimate aim of allowing well-informed
          hiring decisions from both sides. I am sure, our team of placement coordinators and dedicated volunteers will ensure that the
          recruitment process becomes a smooth and pleasing experience for both the recruiters and the students. We are always eager to
          improve and open for any suggestions from recruiters in order to make this experience even better. With this, I again welcome all
          the recruiters to IIT Kanpur.

          IIT Kanpur. Have a happy placement experience.
