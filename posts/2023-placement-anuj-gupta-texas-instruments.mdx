Anuj Gupta, studying in IIT Kanpur as a MT student in EE will be joining Texas Instruments as Analog Design Engineer. Here are some brief insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
- Aura semiconductors(Analog Engineer)- Qualcomm(Hardware Engineer)- ST Microelectronics (Analog Engineer)- Signal Chip(Analog Engineer)

## Insights on the Selection Process
- Technical Test- Interview: The interview went on for half an hour. The panellists were interactive. Panellists aid you inovercoming nervousness. Break the ice in the beginning

##  Preparation Resources
- Chembiyan T RC Circuit And Op-amp analysis lecture series- Prof. Nagendra Krishnapura basic electrical circuit and analog circuit lecture series- Prof. Nagendra Krishnapura Analog IC Design

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Dos:- Focus only on one profile in electronics (either analog or digital)- Be thorough with RC circuits and Opamps- Give intuitive answers rather than mathematical answers.- Prepare in groups for interviews and discuss questions with peersDon’ts- Don’t use Laplace Transform to give answers.
