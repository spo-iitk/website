insights.

The company directly selected students based on resume and CPI without conducting any technical test. There were three people in technical test (one HR, a technical expert and one was senior person from the company).

The interview was around 20-25 minutes and all the interviewers were very friendly.

So, just prepare well and believe in yourself, you will surely get success.
