##  Preparation Resources
For the Coding partI did leetcode and interviewbit.- Some standard data structures and algorithms are like the vocabulary of English. Youhave to know some of them to be able to write code. So start with some standardalgorithms. You can refer to some youtube channels like codencode for graphs, adityaverma for DP, and recursion.- Don’t worry if you are not able to solve everything by yourself from the start. Try toidentify the patterns. For this, a very good resource is leetcode studyplans(https://leetcode.com/study-plan/). Questions are grouped according to thesimilarity of concepts. Even if some of the study plans are paid, you can look for thequestions on GitHub.- Give regular contests on any of the coding sites. I used leetcode for this. This will helpyou to apply what you have learned and will improve your speed too.For puzzles and probability part:- Revise MSO201 or any other probability course from your department.- Do puzzles from the book Practical Guide to Quantitative Finance Interviews ByXinfeng Zhou. You can easily find the pdf.- Brainstellar puzzles.- 50 challenging problems in probability

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Start early and try to solve some questions every day. There is a daily question featureon leetcode and gfg.- Mark the questions and concepts on which you struggled. I made an Excel sheet forthis. Revise them after some days or before a test/interview.- Shortlist 2-3 profiles and prepare for them only. Don’t run after every company andprofile.- Make a small group of people to prepare with. Preparing in a group is always better asyou can discuss doubts. Healthy competition always encourages you to performbetter.- Don’t hesitate to contact seniors. It does not matter whether you know that senior ornot. Just text them with your doubts. You can contact me also.
