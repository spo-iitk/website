Mukund Soni , studying in IIT Kanpur as a BT-ME  student in MSE  will be joining Fourth-Frontier Technologies as Full-stack developer. Here are some brief insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
JPMCBarclaysApollo24x7Urban HealthShipsyJavis

## Insights on the Selection Process
The interview was directly an HR round, because the resume shortlist was highly based ontechnical skills, key projects and experiences based on the profile we applied (in my case Full-stack developer). Then the technical test was also based on Full-stack development, itconsists of two question on backend (we had to write some code to receive some data fromtheir database, and the other I don’t remember), two questions on frontend (we had todevelop a phonebook, and a button which toggles on click), and one coding question (codingquestion level was Leetcode easy).The interview round was mainly to check our communication skills, how we are thinking at themoment, and our confidence. It lasted around 30-40 minutes.

##  Preparation Resources
For coding, first I read the topics from gfg and practice some basic questions on the topic fromthere (Basic and Intermediate). Then I solved the Interview bit for further practice, as it coversquestions asked in interviews. And finally, I solved problems on Leetcode for more practice onsome difficult questions for technical test.For preparations of HR round, we can find some standard questions on gfg and also theiranswers. But according to me we should not give the same answers as found from sources, itshould be purely based on our thoughts, we can just use the resources to know whatquestions are being asked.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
For preparing the technical test, it is of utmost importance that we give coding contestsregularly. We can find weekly and bi-weekly contests on Leetcode, interviewbit, codechef andcodeforces. But majority of the tests in placements, which I gave, were based on the patternof leetcode coding contest, so we should not miss them, and should solve them regularly onfirst priority.
