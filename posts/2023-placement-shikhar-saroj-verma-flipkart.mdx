## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Please pick a few resources and stick to them. Do not worry about resource X beingmarginally better than resource Y. I wasted too much time worrying about what book/resourceto follow. It is all the same. Just make sure you run through whatever source you follow by thetime the interviews start. Holds true for all profiles.It is a great idea to be a part of a small group (~4) of people who are preparing for the sameprofile as you. Really helps in tracking progress. I did not do this and clearly suffered.Please enroll in some MCQ test series to get a taste of the actual setting. The questions aremostly easy but getting a lot of them right needs practice.Surround yourself with supportive people when the interviews start. Let them handle phonecalls and interview call-ups. You can and should focus on running through your resume-related answers and other such things.Don’t get scared about chatter like company X not coming for placements, company Y onlydoing binary hiring…none of it matters by the time placements start. There are more thanenough opportunities for you and your friends. Don’t become a part of the noise and calmyourself and your friends down. SPO works very hard to improve # of companies every year.They will take care of the companies coming in.
