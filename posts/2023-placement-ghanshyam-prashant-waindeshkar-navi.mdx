Ghanshyam Prashant Waindeshkar, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BS student in ECO will be joining Navi as Product Analyst. Here are some brief insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Associate Consultant – Bain &amp; CompanyBusiness Analyst – Mckinsey &amp; Company

## Insights on the Selection Process
The interview process for Navi was pretty straight forward. They released an interviewshortlist based on the resumes (for other profiles they conducted tests) and then there werethree rounds of interviews. Despite interviewing a lot of candidates, the company offered jobto only two candidates so, the number of candidates that were able to convert the interviewinto an offer were very low, and this was same for all the profiles for which the company cameto hire. If I can recall correctly around 35-50 students interviewed for the product profile andonly two of them received the offer, the company gave a total of seven offers across all theprofile.From what I could make-up they had a very high expectations from the candidates, they werelooking for someone who had a really strong profile and also the required fundamentals forthe job.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
1. Strong Profile: Talk to as much seniors as possible, try to understand what thecompanies that you are targeting are looking for in the candidates and ideally yourresume should check all those boxes. (Like in case of consulting and productcompanies look for candidates with good academic records, internships, extra-curricular achievements, Position of responsibility etc.).2. Resume: Making resume is an iterative process and you should never stop workingon it till the date of submission comes. Resumes are what you can consider your firstimpression in front of the recruiters, so its only fair that you invest a decent amount oftime on it.Identify seniors and alums that are working in the companies that you are targetingand try to get multiple reviews from them. A good way to do this is uploading multiplecopies of a single draft of resume on google drive and sending each copy to aparticular senior and they can give you specific review by using the comment features.3. Interview preparation: After securing an interview, everything boils down to twothings (i) Your preparations and (ii) Communication Skills.For product and consulting related profiles you should try to form two case prepgroups of three member each. One should have students who you think are startingwith the same level of preparation as you and in the another you should practice withstudent who are a little ahead in the preparations. There are endless resourcesavailable online so I won’t go into what exactly you should prepare.
