Digital Circuit design (Gate notes are very much enough).6. Memories (SRAM, DRAM V.IMP topic) from rabaey lectures.7. C programming - You just need to practice the MCQs from geeksforgeeks(GFG), butobviously it is better if know how to code also.8. FIFO depth, Synchronizers, Clock Domain Crossing, Computer Architecture (mainlyfor written tests V.IMP topic), Physical design flow and Puzzles from GFG.
