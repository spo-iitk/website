Ananya Gupta, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BT student in CSE will do
her summer internship in Quant profile at Quadeye. Here are some brief
insights of hers.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Goldman Sachs - Summer Analyst, Uber - Software, Graviton - software, Sprinklr - Software, Microsoft -Both software and data science 

## Insights on the Selection Process
I gave interviews for 3 companies out of the ones I was shortlisted for. 

1.) Goldman Sachs:- 
I had 2 rounds, some people had to appear for 3. Both were technical rounds. In my first round, I was asked 3 questions. One was based on basic probability, one was based on DFS in a matrix (just the algorithm, not coding) and last one was an analytical puzzle. In the second round, it started with a discussion on my second year summer intern, then I was asked differences between arrays and linked lists, where can doubly linked lists be used in real life, etc. Then, there was a question on indexing in a DBMS, 2-3 direct questions from 50CP/brainstellar. The second round was much longer than the first one. 

2.) Quadeye:-
Here, I had continuous 4-5 rounds without break, some were even 10 minute rounds. The questions were mostly based on probability and puzzles (not from brainstellar/50 CP, you need to think fast on the spot), 1-2 questions on describing the algorithm for a particular problem and even some on mental math (like 105 square, 39*41, etc).

3.) Uber:-
I gave one round only, since Quadeye made an on the spot offer. I had to code two questions, they were pretty straightforward. One was based on prefix sum and hashmaps and other was based on DFS on a binary tree.

##  Preparation Resources
1.) For coding practice - Interview Bit and LeetCode

2.) For probability and puzzles - 50 CP, Brainstellar and IB puzzles

3.) For statistics - YouTube videos on hypothesis testing, regression 

4.) For OOPS theory - Tutorialspoint, Gfg

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
For tests:- The hard part is getting shortlisted for interviews. Try to do regular coding practice over the summers if you're aiming for SDE profiles. I didn't do codeforces, codechef, etc, I focused on IB/LC only. For quant companies, few of them don't take tests and CPI plays an important role there. Like for GS, a high CPI will give you a better shortlisting chance even if you mess up your test. APT portfolio, alphagrep, GS, etc will have a section of questions on probability and statistics, JEE type math. Having practiced timed tests will definitely help you out here. For data science roles, brush up your ML knowledge. MS data science test had 2 questions in which we had to code models (regression using sklearn, etc) and also a section on theoretical MCQs. 

Revise all concepts of DSA, have a good theoretical grasp. Do not skip over graphs part while practicing coding. Be thorough with OOPS concepts too. Do not forget to do brainstellar and 50 CP if you're aiming for quant profiles (can be done in 2-3 days). In your summers, trying doing one project/intern in the area you're interested in along with intern prep. 
For interviews, try doing 1-2 mock interviews before you give the real ones, it'll help you adjust to interview setting. 

Lastly, keep in touch with seniors, ask them about the companies you're aiming for and their procedure. Take tips from them. It'll help you guide your preparation in the right direction.
