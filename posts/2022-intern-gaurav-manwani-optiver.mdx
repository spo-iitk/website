Gaurav Manwani, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BS student in Mathematics will do
his summer internship in Quant Trader profile at Optiver. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Optiver (Quant Trader), Jane Street(Quant), Optiver(Software), Sprinklr(Software) and APT Portfolio

## Insights on the Selection Process
Knowledge of various puzzles came in handy. Software interviews had questions on advanced DS (heaps and trees), computer fundamentals and cryptography applications (since it was mentioned in my resume). Some parts also connected to networking and systems design, although these topics weren't mandatory to cover.Quant interviews involved a lot of probability puzzles and games based on expected value (with added time constraints from the interviewers just to check how you react under pressure)

##  Preparation Resources
InterviewBit for DSA practice, 50 challenging problems for quant prep

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
The first and foremost advice would be to be patient, and wait for the right opportunities rather than jumping blindly into everything. Build a strong academic background related to the profiles you're targeting. Try to be technically adept in DSA (and/or quant topics) by the time of tests.
However, confidence is key for the interviews. Express your ideas freely and try to catch hints from the interviewer (trust me, they give a lot of subtle hints). Appropriate technical preparation always gives you a boost, but practice handling situations where you don't have any technical knowledge to answer the question. Reacting well to a pressure situation even when you're clueless about the question/subject is the most important interview skill in my opinion.
Be patient, prepare well, and let your heart out! Best of luck!
