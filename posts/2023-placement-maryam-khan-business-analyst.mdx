PPO Unilever (Unilever Future Leaders Program: Supply Chain manager)Microsoft (SDE)J.P. Morgan (Analyst)Morgan Stanley (Analyst)N K Securities (Business Operations)BCG (Associate)Sprinklr (Business Analyst)Bain and Company (Associate Consultant)

## Insights on the Selection Process
-General calls from the company after shortlisting.-Panelists were Seniors/Partners of the company.-HR questions like COVID pandemic experience, accomplishments in college, gaps onresume, poor performance if any etc.-Questions were majorly based on resume.-Guesstimates and case study on topics related to resume, in my case, but from generaloverview, it varied.

##  Preparation Resources
IIT Bombay Case bookIITB Videos on youtubeSRCC Case bookIIT Ahmedabad Framework of cases.Note: Exchanging cases with peers, practicing with seniors and buddy etc was of great help.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Dos:-Start building your profile and peaks early; genuine over-the-years development >> last-minute self projects-Familiarize yourself with frameworks of different types of cases; Practice on a shuffled basis.-As you practice cases, customize the frameworks to add your mistakes/missing perspectives.-Process and logic are more important than your final answers in guesstimates. Soconcentrate on your logic more than the answers.-Resume headers are important. Quantification is imperative. How you label yourachievements and projects is vital.-Believe in yourself. Introduce yourself as if you have undergone a very exciting and insightfuljourney, and its your chance to present yourself.Don’ts:-Don’t focus on extremely diverse profiles. Being selective from the start saves time and effort.-Don’t write over-exaggerated stuff on your resume; Write only the points you can defend.(Moderate resume + good defense >> Good resume + Poor defense)-Don’t use repetitive and filler words during interviews. Take time to think MECE structurewhile cases. Taking time >> Irrelevant facts-Don’t overtire yourself in the last few days, solving cases require a fresh mind.
