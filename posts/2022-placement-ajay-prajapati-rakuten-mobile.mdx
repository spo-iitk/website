Ajay Prajapati, studying in IIT Kanpur as a Dual Degree student in MTH will be joining Rakuten Mobile as Software Engineer. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
I was shortlisted and interviewed by Graviton for the Quantative Researcher profile and by
Google for the Software Developer profile. I was shortlisted in other day 2 companies as well
but I was placed before interview.

## Insights on the Selection Process
1. Resume Shortlist
2. Test
3. Interview

Sample Interview Questions:

1) Introduce Yourself.
2) Why should Rakuten hire you?
3) What technologies are you interested in?
4) Are you comfortable moving to Japan?


##  Preparation Resources
I used Interviewbit for coding practice. I learned and practiced Machine Learning commands
in Panda by watching YouTube videos (codebasics channel). I revised the courses MSO201,
ESC101, and ESO207.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
1. Start your placement preparation as early as you can.
2. Keep your academics load as minimum as possible because placement season is very hectic with lots of tests to write and lots of forms to fill.
3. Also make time to improve your communication skills. Prepare the basic HR questions well.
