Yash Gupta, studying in IIT Kanpur as a Double Major student in Eco and CSE will do
his summer internship in Systems   profile at Quantbox. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
● Google- SDE
● Graviton-SDE
● Alphagrep-SDE
● DE Shaw- SDE

## Insights on the Selection Process
This time, the initial shortlisting was done based on the Resume.
Generally, it happens based on the technical test.
In Resume, they mainly looked for:
-CPI
-Branch\{Preferably CEM Or Double Major in the CEM\}

Sample Interview
/Test Questions
-TEST
1. MCQs about 15 in number consisted of C++ questions and DSA
Questions. Topics covered were: OOPs, Virtual Functions,
Reference Variables, Smart Pointers, Mutex, etc
2. CODING QUESTIONS\{2 in number\}:
-Greedy Approach
-Expected Value was to be found out, but was on a trickier side.
Interview
Duration: 45min to 1hr
Interview Questions:
- The Interview began with a question on Computer

Organization, but I had not done the Course CS220, so they
changed the topics of the questions.
- Asked a DSA Question, which could be solved by greedy
approach after little bit of thinking.
- They further questioned on C++ Concepts, specifically
1.What is the difference between ordered and unordered
map?
2. How are the clashes resolved in hashing used in
unordered map?
- Reference Variables and Passing by Reference.
- OOPS:
Polymorphism and Inheritance and how C++ Implements it?
Virtual Functions were also touched upon.
Interview Tips:
Be Confident
If you don’t know about the topics, its better to confess and think
on logics. Because, the interviewer wants to see the way you
approach the Question, even if you are unable to get to the
specific answer.

##  Preparation Resources
-Learn C through ESC101
-Go through C++ STL and start Competitive Programming as early as possible.
-In Summers,
1. InterviewBit and CP on CodeForces
If you are aiming for Systems/SDE in HFTs
-Learn C++ Language concepts and OOPS(Much Important)
Revise CS220 Course
General Resources:
-Geeks For Geeks
- https://cp-algorithms.com/ for General Algorithms Reference.
- Learn DSA from a course or any preferable website or a playlist. But, practice makes the
difference. So, its much important to practice on InterviewBit and LeetCode.
Youtube Playlist for C++:

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Dos-
Don’t be late to start
If one has done basic competitive programming, it would take entire summer to master DSA.
