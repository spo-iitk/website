## Insights on the Selection Process
First round was product centric. I was asked about my favourite product and then theinterviewer started grilling upon that same product by asking questions like what new featurecan you think which can be added to this product and started asking some technical questionsregarding the same .Also some philosophical kind of about your journey and how you takeyour life as were asked. First round was common to all the profiles. Second round was thegrowth round where I was asked questions about my growth intern and then the interviewerstarted asking some situation based questions where he was giving me different scenariosand I had to provide the solution for the same. Then the third and the last round was HRround.

##  Preparation Resources

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Main thing for PM, consulting or any managerial role is case preparation.While preparing forcases (product or consulting) never just read the solution of the case.Try to set up the interview environment and ask your friend to give you a case . Set thetimer(initially it’ll be hard to complete it on time) and try to solve that within the set time. Afteryou are done with your case , read the solution and write the things which you missed outwhich could have made your solution better. And also you should first focus on the structureby which you’ll be solving the case that will help you in not diverting from the problem andyou’ll reach the solution easily.
